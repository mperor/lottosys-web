# Lottery Prediction Application (lottosys ðŸ”¢)

## Overview

This project is dedicated to a lottery prediction application for the Lotto and Lotto Plus games. The application utilizes three systems:

1. ðŸŸ£ **Random System:** Generates random numbers for consecutive lottery tickets.
2. ðŸŸ¢ **Static System:** Utilizes random number generation but retains a given ticket for the next draw if it did not match at least two numbers.
3. ðŸŸ  **Math System:** Based on the delta lotto system, which involves a mathematical approach to lottery number selection.

The main objective of this project is to verify which of these systems performs the best, or if any of them are viable at all.
